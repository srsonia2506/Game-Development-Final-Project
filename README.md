# CSS385-GroupProjects

Website: <https://rees-anderson.github.io/CSS385-GroupProjects/>

Our shared repository for group projects!

I gave each member their own branch, named accordingly with the person's first name. Please clone and push only to your own branch - if you want your code to be merged with another person's branch create a pull request. When you are ready to send a game component to the main branch message me on discord and send a pull-request and I can handle the transfer :)

Note: If you have questions about the github repository, or something doesn't seem to be working as expected - send a message to the github text channel on our discord!
